# Acoustic Propagation in an Atmospheric Medium
## Description
This project contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that implement various functionalities allowing for numerical simulations of acoustic propagation in atmospheric media. The Jupyter Notebooks are designed with non-homogeneous atmospheric models without refraction, but they can be replaced with others.

## Installation
To install Jupyter Notebook, you can use pip: 
            pip install notebook

The packages used, with their associated pip command, are shown within each Notebook.

## Usage
To use these notebooks, you first need to start Jupyter Notebook in your local environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: 
            jupyter notebook

Then, simply navigate to the notebook you wish to open.
